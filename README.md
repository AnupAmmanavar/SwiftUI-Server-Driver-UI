Please go to this __[Server-Driven-UI Architecture using UIComponents](https://medium.com/better-programming/build-a-server-driven-ui-using-ui-components-in-swiftui-466ecca97290)__ if you would like to read it on [Medium](https://medium.com/better-programming/build-a-server-driven-ui-using-ui-components-in-swiftui-466ecca97290) platform

This article will talk about 
* Server-Driven UI, 
* Its implementation using re-usable components called `UIComponents`, and
* Creating a generic vertical list view for rendering UI components. 
* tIt will conclude with a brief discussion of how UI components can serve different purposes.

## What Is Server-Driven UI? ##
* It is an architecture where the server decides the UI views that need to be rendered on the application screen.
* There exists a contract between the application and the server. The basis of this __contract__ gives the server control over the UI of the application.


#### Contract ðŸ¤”
* The server defines the list of components. 
* For each of the components defined at the server, we have a corresponding UI implementation in the app (UIComponent). 


 Consider an entertainment app like Hotstar, whose contract is defined as shown below. On the left are the components from the server(__ServerComponent__), and on the right are the corresponding __UI Components__.

#### Working #### 
* The screen does not have a predefined layout like a storyboard. Rather, it consists of a generic list view rendering multiple different views vertically, as per the server response. 
* To make it possible, we have to create views that are standalone and can be reused throughout the application. We call these re-usable views the UIComponent.

#### Contract #### 
> For every ServerComponent, we have a corresponding UIComponent.


### SwiftUI ###
 Swift is a UI toolkit that lets you design application screens in a programmatic, declarative way.
```swift
  struct NotificationView: View {
      let notificationMessage: String

      var body: some View {
          Text(notificationMessage)
      }
  }
```

## Server-Driven UI Implementation in SwiftUI ##

This is a three-step process.
1. Define the standalone UIComponents.
2. Construct the UIComponents based on the API response.
3. Render the UIComponents on the screen.

### Step 1 - Define standalone UIComponents ###

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*vaTfkYDRJuPnUQm8nYskgQ.png)

__Input:__ Firstly, for the UIComponent to render itself, it should be provided with data.<br/>  __Output:__ UIComponent defines its UI. When used for rendering inside a screen, it renders itself based on the data (input) provided to it.


#### UIComponent implementation ####

```swift
protocol UIComponent {
    var uniqueId: String  { get }
    func render() -> AnyView
}
```

* All the UI views have to conform to this UI-component protocol.
* As the components are rendered inside a generic vertical list, each UIComponent has to be independently identified. The `uniqueId` property is used to serve that purpose.
* The `render()` is where the UI of the component is defined. Calling this function on a screen will render the component. 

Let's look at NotificationComponent.


```swift
struct NotificationComponent: UIComponent {
    var uniqueId: String
    
    // The data required for rendering is passed as a dependency
    let uiModel: NotificationUIModel
    
    // Defines the View for the Component
    func render() -> AnyView {
        NotificationView(uiModel: uiModel).toAny()
    }
}

// Contains the properties required for rendering the Notification View
struct NotificationUIModel {
    let header: String
    let message: String
    let actionText: String
}

// Notification view takes the NotificationUIModel as a dependency
struct NotificationView: View {
    let uiModel: NotificationUIModel
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Text(uiModel.header)
            Text(uiModel.message)
            Button(action: {}) {
                Text(uiModel.actionText)
            }
        }
    }
}
```

* `NotificationUIModel` is the data required by the component to render. This is the input to the UIComponent.
* `NotificationView` is a SwiftUI view that defines the UI of the component. It takes in `NotificationUIModel` as a dependency. This view is the output of the UIComponent when used for rendering on the screen.


### Step 2 - Construct the UIComponents based on the API response ###
```swift
 class HomePageController: ObservableObject {
 
    let repository: Repository
    @Published var uiComponents: [UIComponent] = []
  
    ..
    .. 
    
    func loadPage() {
        val response = repository.getHomePageResult()
        response.forEach { serverComponent in
          let uiComponent = parseToUIComponent(serverComponent)
          uiComponents.append(uiComponent)
        }
    }
}

func parseToUIComponent(serverComponent: ServerComponent) -> UIComponent {
  var uiComponent: UIComponent
  
  if serverComponent.type == "NotificationComponent" {
    uiComponent = NotificationComponent(serverComponent.data, serverComponent.id)
  }
  else if serverComponent.type == "GenreListComponent" {
    uiComponent = GenreListComponent(serverComponent.data, serverComponent.id)
  }
  ...
  ...
  return uiComponent
}
```

* `HomePageController` loads the server components from the repository and converts them into the UIComponents.
* The `uiComponent`'s property is responsible for holding the list of UIComponents. Wrapping it with the `@Published` property makes it an observable. Any change in its value will be published to the `Observer(View)`. *__This makes it possible to keep the View in sync with the state of the application.__*


### Step 3 - Render UIComponents on the screen using Generic List ###
This the last part. The screenâ€™s only responsibility is to render the `UIComponents`. 
* It subscribes to the `uiComponents` observable. 
* Whenever the value of the `uiComponents` changes, the `HomePage` is notified, which then updates its UI. 
* A generic ListView is used for rendering the UIComponents

```swift
struct HomePageView: View {
    
    @ObservedObject var controller: HomePageViewModel
    
    var body: some View {
    
        ScrollView(.vertical) {
            VStack {
                ForEach(controller.uiComponents, id: \.uniqueId) { uiComponent in
                    uiComponent.render()
                }
            }
        }
        .onAppear(perform: {
            self.controller.loadPage()
        })
        
    }
}
```

#### Rendering using Generic Vstack #### 
  All the UIComponents are rendered vertically using a VStack inside. As the UIComponents are uniquely identifiable, we can use the `ForEach` construct for rendering.
  
 Since all the components conforming to UIComponent protocol must return a common type, *__the render() function returns AnyView__*. Below is an extension on the View for converting it toAnyView.
 ```swift
extension View {
    func toAny() -> AnyView {
        return AnyView(self)
    }
}
```

## Conclusion ##
We saw how `UIComponent` can be used to give the server control over the UI of the application. But with UIComponents you can achieve something more.

Letâ€™s consider a case without server-driven UI. It's often the case that the pieces of UI are used many times across the application. This leads to duplication of the view and view logic. So, itâ€™s better to divide the UI into meaningful, reusable UI-components.

Having them this way will let the domain-layer/business layer define and construct the UI components. Additionally, the business-layer can take the responsibility of controlling the UI.

Have a look at the article __[Android Jetpack Compose â€” Create a Component-Based Architecture](https://medium.com/better-programming/create-a-component-based-architecture-in-android-jetpack-compose-96980c191351)__, which explains UI-Components in detail. As it uses Jetpack compose-Androidâ€™s declarative UI kit, it wouldnâ€™t be hard to understand.
